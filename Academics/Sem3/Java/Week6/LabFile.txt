You can remove an object Rajesh by using remove( ). To remove a group of objects, call
removeAll( ). You can remove all elements except those of a specified group by calling
retainAll( ). To empty a collection, call clear( ).
You can determine whether a collection contains a specific object by calling contains( ).
To determine whether one collection contains all the members of another, call containsAll( ).
You can determine when a collection is empty by calling isEmpty( ). The number of elements
currently held in a collection can be determined by calling size( ).
The toArray( ) methods return an array that contains the elements stored in the invoking
collection. The first returns an array of Object. The second returns an array of elements that
have the same type as the array specified as a parameter. Normally, the second form is more
convenient because it returns the desired array type. These methods are more important than
it might at first seem. Often, processing the contents of a collection by using array-like syntax
is advantageous. By providing a pathway between collections and arrays, you can have the
best of both worlds.
